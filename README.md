## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can classify images into one of 10 categories using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained, evaluated, and tested to demonstrate its effectiveness in solving an image classification problem.

The project includes the following:
- Data preprocessing
- Building a CNN model using Keras
- Training the model
- Evaluating the model's performance
